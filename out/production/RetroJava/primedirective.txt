As the right of each sentient species to live in accordance 
with its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, 
no Starfleet personnel may interfere with the normal and 
healthy development of alien life and culture. 
Such interference includes introducing superior knowledge, 
strength, or technology to a world whose society is 
incapable of handling such advantages wisely. 
Starfleet personnel may not violate this Prime Directive, 
even to save their lives and/or their ship, unless they are 
acting to right an earlier violation or an accidental 
contamination of said culture. 
This directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations, 
and carries with it the highest moral obligation.
